This is another approach to pull code inside image and build JAR from our GraduationWork.
Resulting image is smaller compared to my previous example (04graduationWorkBuildJar)
JAR can be started later in docker container with the following command:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --rm maven_build_jar java -jar /gw-spring-boot/spring-boot-tests/spring-boot-smoke-tests/spring-boot-smoke-test-web-ui/target/spring-boot-smoke-test-web-ui-2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
